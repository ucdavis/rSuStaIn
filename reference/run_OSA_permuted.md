Randomly permute some some variables and run the OSA model on the
permuted data

## Usage

``` r
run_OSA_permuted(
  permutation_seeds = 1:100,
  permuting_variables = "Gender",
  patient_data,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- permutation_seeds:

  random number generator seeds to use to permute the data

- permuting_variables:

  which variables to permute

- patient_data:

  patient biomarker data

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`run_OSA`](https://UCD-IDDRC.github.io/fxtas/reference/run_OSA.md)

  `prob_score`

  :   [array](https://rdrr.io/r/base/array.html) probability of each
      score for all subjects across all biomarkers

      - dim = number of subjects x number of biomarkers x number of
        scores

  `score_vals`

  :   a matrix specifying the scores for each biomarker

      - dim: number of biomarkers x number of scores

  `SuStaInLabels`

  :   the names of the biomarkers as a list of strings

  `N_startpoints`

  :   number of startpoints to use in maximum likelihood step of
      SuStaIn, typically 25

  `N_S_max`

  :   maximum number of subtypes, should be 1 or more

  `N_iterations_MCMC`

  :   number of MCMC iterations, typically 1e5 or 1e6 but can be lower
      for debugging

  `output_folder`

  :   where to save pickle files, etc.

  `dataset_name`

  :   for naming pickle files

  `use_parallel_startpoints`

  :   boolean for whether or not to parallelize the maximum likelihood
      loop

  `seed`

  :   random number seed for python code

  `plot`

  :   [`logical()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/logical.html) indicating
      whether to construct PVD plots via python subroutines

  `N_CV_folds`

  :   number of cross-validation folds to create

  `CV_fold_nums`

  :   which CV folds to run (for parallel processing)

  `verbose`

  :   [`logical()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/logical.html) indicating
      whether to print debugging information

  `keep_data`

  :   [`logical()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/logical.html) indicating
      whether to include the ata in the return object

  `fig_size`

  :   python figure size, in inches (width, height)

  `prob_correct`

  :   the probability of correctly classifying the underlying biomarker
      level: p(obs = true)

  `biomarker_levels`

  :   a list containing the levels for each biomarker

## Value

[NULL](https://rdrr.io/r/base/NULL.html), invisibly (.pickle and .rds
files are generated to save the output)
