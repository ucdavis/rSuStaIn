# fxtas

The goal of `fxtas` is to apply the Ordinal SuStaIn algorithm (Young et
al. (2021)) to study disease progression in fragile X-associated
tremor/ataxia syndrome,  
as described in Morrison et al (not yet published), “Progression of
fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome revealed by subtype and
stage inference”.

## Installation

You can install the development version of fxtas from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UCD-IDDRC/fxtas")
```

## Running the analyses

The manuscript is implemented in the file `ordinal-sustain.qmd` in the
`analyses` subfolder, which incorporates several subfiles in this
repository. The `data-raw` folder contains numerous auxiliary scripts,
including:

- data preprocessing scripts, which be run in the following order (after
  extracting the necessary files from the GP, GP4, and Trax research
  databases):

  - `gp3.r`
  - `gp4.r`
  - `gp34.R`
  - `trax.R`

- [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) batch scripts
  and corresponding R scripts for pre-running the computation-heavy
  sections of the analysis on an appropriately-preconfigured distributed
  computing server.

If the corresponding output files have not been pre-generated,
`ordinal-sustain.qmd` should produce them.
